How do I make it so that you can only submit one form a day?

How do I make a Login page and have two separate sites? One for Admin and One for Client?


I want the user to select on of two options. Yes or No. I want A boolean value to be associated with
these options so that when it is submitted we are sending a 1 or 0, a true or false.

Updating

I want to put a button in the client list to EDIT the clients information
The button should forward to client/edit + individual id

Now we must set up a route for client/edit/:id

--------------------

Setting up the DELETE functionality
-Set up the delete button
    the HREF goes nowhere.
    We're adding a delete class: delete-client
    The idea is that we're using this class as a handle to grab onto with JQUERY and make a delete request.
    We need to know which id in order to specify which clientinfo to delete.
    He puts an attribute called data-id that's equal to the clientinfo._id

    After wards we're placing a main.js file in our public/js
        This is the client side js file

    This is the part that gets tricky. We're issuing an AJAX request.

JQUERY
    
    1. The site cannot be safely manipulated until it's fully loaded.
    Jquery detects the readiness state. The code inside this function runs
    when jquery detects when it is in that state.
    
    $(document).ready(function(){
    
    });

    2. Here we're going to grab on to the class we created with the button and use a 
    method on it.

    The on method accepts an event and a function
    
    
    $(document).ready(function(){
        $('delete-client').on('click', function(e){
            $target = $(e.target)
            console.log($target.attr('data-id') 
        })
    
    });

    !!! Not sure how $target works !!!

    however, the $target.attr('data-id') successfully grabs the ._id

    we can now store the id int a variable

    const id = $target.attr('data-id)

    NOW we are sending the ajax request that looks something like this:

    $.ajax({
        type: 'DELETE',
        url: '
    })
