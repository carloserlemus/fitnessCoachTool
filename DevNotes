How do I make it so that you can only submit one form a day?

How do I make a Login page and have two separate sites? One for Admin and One for Client?


I want the user to select on of two options. Yes or No. I want A boolean value to be associated with
these options so that when it is submitted we are sending a 1 or 0, a true or false.

Updating

I want to put a button in the client list to EDIT the clients information
The button should forward to client/edit + individual id

Now we must set up a route for client/edit/:id
